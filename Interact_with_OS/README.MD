##Interact with the Operating System
##test1.py: The file_date function creates a new file in the current working directory, checks the date that the file was modified, and returns just the date portion of the timestamp in the format of yyyy-mm-dd. Fill in the gaps to create a file called "newfile.txt" and check the date that it was modified.
##test2.py: For this lab, imagine you are an IT Specialist at a medium-sized company. The Human Resources Department at your company wants you to find out how many people are in each department. You need to write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a list of the employees in the organization, counts how many people are in each department, and then generates a report using this information. The output of this script will be a plain text file. We will guide you through each step of the lab.
